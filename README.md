# Tic-Tac-Toe


Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game project! This simple web-based game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering an interactive and fun experience for players of all ages. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, installation instructions, and how to play the game.

### Project Overview

This project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in a web browser, utilizing HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic. Players take turns clicking on the game board to place their "X" or "O" markers, aiming to create a row, column, or diagonal of their markers to win the game.

3. **Winning Condition:** The first player to get three of their markers consecutively in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
